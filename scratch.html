                        Myelin is javascript a tool for linking document elements to Backbone model attributes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Have you ever tried to link forms to models in a Backbone.js app? If so, you've probably written
                        event handlers and lots of piping code to get things working. If you find this piping boring then
                        myelin is for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For instance, let's say you have a span that welcomes your users, like this:
                    </p>
                    <span class="example">Welcome, <span class="username">Anonymous</span></span>
                    <p>
                        And you have a Backbone model with a "username" attribute, like this:
                    <p>
                    <pre>
                        class UserModel extends Backbone.Model
                            defaults:
                                username: 'Anonymous'
                        user = new UserModel
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        And you want the span to automatically update with the username.
                        With myelin, this task is trivial! Just make myelin view.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        new class UserView extends myelin.View
                            model: user
                            sync:
                                username: '.username'
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        BAM! You're done. In fact, you can try out the code right now. Just enter
                        a username in the field below.
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        Note: myelin.View extends Backbone.View, so you still get all the sexy Backbone magic.
                    </code>
                    <input name="username">
                    <p>
                        Wow, that was fast. That worked because we also linked the input to the username attribute.
                        How did we do that? Like this:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        new class UpdateUserView extends myelin.View
                            model: user
                            sync:
                                username: 'keyup [name=username]'
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        You might want to pop open a console and check model.get('username') to keep us honest.
                    <p>
                        Of course, these are one-off views (note the use of `new class`) that operate
                        in the global scope (notice how the views have no `el`). That's great for
                        simple examples, but not for real apps. For real apps you'll want reusable
                        views, like this:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        class LinkInputToOutput extends myelin.View
                            sync:
                                text: ['input', '.output']
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        Now, if you have two different inputs with adjacent spans
                    </p>
                    <div id="group1">
                        <input><span class="output"></span>
                    </div>
                    <div id="group2">
                        <input><span class="output"></span>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        You can set up the links like this:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        group1view = new LinkInputToOutput el: '#group1', model: new Backbone.Model
                        group2view = new LinkInputToOutput el: '#group2', model: new Backbone.Model
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        Go ahead. Try em!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Notice how myelin intelligently figures out what you're trying to do.
                        When you link an attribute to a span, the span reacts to changes
                        in the model. When you link an attribute to an input, changing the
                        input updates the model.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By default, myelin listens to the 'change' events of inputs. You can see how
                        easy it is to override that default and listen for 'keyup' events instead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can, of course, override all of myelin's default behavior. You can provide
                        your own event handlers. You can provide your own get, set, clean, and render
                        functions. You can customize which events are listened to. And don't worry,
                        myelin is [[pretty smart]] has [[sensible defaults]].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you're intersted, check out the [[documentation]]. If you're feeling bold, you can learn even
                        more tips and tricks from the [[annotated source]].

        Sensible defaults:
        - we warn on using passwords. Don't!
        - we have some cool shorthand
        - buttons don't listen to models
        - input _does_ listen to models
        - textareas are keyup, other inputs are change

        Smart
        - we use delegate when possible
        - we auto-update on model/dom change
        - you can even change _types_
        - we'll parse your events out from under you
        - yes, event classes work
        - yep, we handle checkboxes and radio buttons
        - submit won't submit things
        - use 'this' to bind *on* the view 'el'
